## üåü About the Project

This project is a pedagogical implementation of a mini-store management system, developed as a practical lab exercise. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variable manipulation, control flow (`if/else`, `switch`), loops (`while`), and user interaction via the console. The application is structured in three progressive levels, each introducing more complex logic and features.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Dynamic Product Management**: Add products with name, price, and quantity through an interactive console prompt.
-   **Real-time Stock Valuation**: Automatically calculate and display the total monetary value of the current stock.
-   **Conditional Logic**: Implements smart business rules, such as automatic discounts for high-value items and stock status alerts.
-   **Interactive Menu System**: A user-friendly, menu-driven interface for seamless navigation and control.
-   **Input Validation**: Robust handling of user input to ensure smooth and predictable application behavior.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture & Learning Progression

The application is built incrementally across three distinct levels, showcasing a clear learning path.

### Level 1: Core Concepts
*Focus: Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operators.*
-   Demonstrates variable declaration and basic arithmetic operations.
-   Introduces `if/else` conditional statements for applying discounts and checking stock levels.

### Level 2: Dynamic Interaction
*Focus: Loops and User Input.*
-   Integrates `prompt()` for dynamic data entry from the user.
-   Utilizes a `while` loop to enable the addition of multiple products in a single session, enhancing user experience.

### Level 3: Interactive Menu System
*Focus: Control Flow and System Simulation.*
-   Implements a `while(true)` loop to create a persistent main menu.
-   Employs a `switch` or nested `if/else` structure to handle complex user choices and program flow.
-   Provides granular feedback on stock status (Out of Stock, Low Stock, Available).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   A JavaScript runtime environment. You can use:
    -   **Node.js** (Recommended) - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    -   Any modern web browser's developer console (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lagmouchyoussef/Mini-Store-Management-System.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Mini-Store-Management-System
    ```

### Usage

#### Using Node.js (Recommended)

Run the application from your terminal. The main script is typically `main.js`, `app.js`, or `index.js`.

```bash
node index.js
```

The interactive menu will appear in your terminal, guiding you through the available options.

#### Using a Web Browser

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2.  Open the Developer Console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3.  The program will start, and you will interact with it via the browser's `prompt` dialogs.
